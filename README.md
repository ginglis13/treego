# treego

An implementation of the Unix [tree](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tree) command in Go.

Looking to practice Go a bit more.

**Current WIP**

### TODO


1. Flags - some I'm gonna do:

```	--help
	-a 	    All files are listed
	-d 	    List directories only
	-f          Print full path prefixes
	-i          Do not print any indendation prefixes
	-s          Print size of each file
```

There's a bunch more, this is it for now

2. Final report (X directories, X files)

I hope to write this in Rust and maybe C eventually.
